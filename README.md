# DALL-E Playground

This repository contains a Streamlit app that allows you to generate AI-generated images using the Stable Diffusion model, similar to DALLE-2. 

## Installation

To run this application locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up your OpenAI credentials by creating a `.env` file and adding your `OPENAI_BASE` and `OPENAI_KEY`.
4. Run the Streamlit app with the command `streamlit run main.py`.

## Usage

Once you have set up and launched the application, you can use it to generate AI-generated images based on prompts.

1. Enter your idea in the text input field provided.
2. Click enter or submit.
3. The app will generate a prompt based on your idea and display it along with an image generated by Stable Diffusion.

Example ideas:
- Cat
- Dog
- Landscape with mountains
- Abstract art

The generated image will be displayed along with its corresponding prompt.

## Code Explanation

The code is divided into several parts:

1. Importing necessary libraries and setting up environment variables using dotenv.
2. Defining a template for generating prompts based on user ideas.
3. Creating functions for making prompts and generating images using Stable Diffusion API calls.
4. Setting up a Streamlit interface where users can enter their ideas, generate prompts, and view resulting images.

The main functionality lies within `make_prompt()` function which generates prompts using user-provided ideas, and `stabble_difussion()` function which generates images based on those prompts.
